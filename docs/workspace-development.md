# Working workspace: first implementation

The new interface ships as **v2.0.0-beta.1**. `/eBirdTripPlanner/trips` is the library and `/eBirdTripPlanner/workspace` is the sole editor/visitor view. Historical notes below describe its development from the [initial specification](v0.5-implementation.md), whose original filename predates the v2 release naming. Local review prototypes and their personal fixtures are excluded from Git and release builds. See [release notes](../CHANGELOG.md) for the current release scope and known limitations.

## Local and cloud behavior

Open an existing local trip through Workspace. Stable UUIDs are added to stops without replacing numeric device-local IDs, and legacy hours/kilometres convert to explicit minutes/metres in the shared plan. The original trip, EBD and personal list records stay in this browser. The reviewed integrated itinerary/details layout is the working editor: Map and Species keep the same selection, optional notes and targets stay compact, full-trip scope is a single action, and resizable panels, bulk time shifts, keyboard undo/redo, draggable stop markers and four radius handles are connected to real IndexedDB plans. Preview and visitor links use this same presentation.

Choose the trip's time zone in Trip options before enabling cloud autosave. A legacy itinerary's wall-clock times are preserved; the application does not guess that a trip is in the planning device's time zone.

Enable cloud autosave explicitly after signing in. For an existing linked trip, its owner performs this migration. One sanitized compressed source archive is uploaded through the existing cloud allowance; it excludes the plan, list records and personal species flags. The source stays private to authorized editors. The shared plan is published separately to `workspaces/<cloud-trip-id>`. Future itinerary edits update that compact Firestore record, without recompressing or uploading the dataset. Existing cloud archives are still supported until migrated; migrated trips open the workspace from the legacy Trips library and cannot be overwritten through legacy archive saving.

The first format accepts at most 500 stops and a 700 KiB JSON plan, leaving space under Firestore's document limit. Route geometries are compact JSON strings because Firestore does not support nested coordinate arrays. The real Oman plan has 63 stops, 62 routes and an approximately 166 KB shared plan. Dataset uploads still use the existing 50 MiB compressed limit. This is an explicit bounded first format, not a claim of unlimited plan or dataset scaling. Shared source references across multiple alternative plans and dataset replacement are subsequent work.

Edits persist through the existing IndexedDB writes. Autosave observes only plan fields, so recalculated stop statistics do not trigger uploads. A durable base snapshot, pending plan and stable commit ID support retries and lost acknowledgements. Web Locks serialize coordinators in tabs on the same device; Firestore transactions and monotonic generations prevent competing devices from silently overwriting one another. Coordinators continue while using other application pages.

When a newer cloud revision appears, a local plan that differs from its base is saved atomically to `workspaceRecovery` before loading the shared plan. Recovery does not require connectivity or a free cloud slot. A persistent notice opens the saved stop details and offers a JSON download. Reapply desired changes manually; no automatic merge, full-trip overwrite or automatic removal of recovery records is provided. A recovery download contains the plan, not another complete EBD copy; full archive backups remain available separately.

Visitors download/cache only the shared plan and public eBird report data; they never download the private source archive. New sharing links open `/workspace?cloud=<id>`; invited editors use `&edit=1`. Notes and stop targets are shared. Public viewing and editor invitations retain the existing owner-controlled permissions. Migration closes anonymous access to the source archive, including through the old archive URL. Cached visitor data can be used offline after an online opening; downloaded copies cannot be recalled after access is revoked. Map tile availability remains separate.

## Running and validation

Normal local development uses `npm run dev`. Production Firebase rules have not been deployed by this implementation. Test against the demo Firebase project first; enabling cloud autosave against the production project requires the updated rules to be deployed together with the app. A workspace-permission preflight runs before changing any source archive, so an older server fails without replacing the existing cloud trip.

```
npm test
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:workspace
npm run build
```

`test:workspace` starts Authentication, Firestore and Storage emulators for `demo-ebird-trip-planner`, runs the permission suite, makes a test-only production PWA build, and runs browser checks in separate persistent device profiles. It covers migration, actual editor input, autosave, Map/Species switching, offline editing and reload, reconnect, unchanged source revisions, anonymous visitor sharing, invited-editor access, personal flags excluded from the shared dataset, conflicting offline edits, recovery download and lost acknowledgements. Test accounts and data remain in the emulators. Java 17 matches the pinned Firebase CLI. `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH` optionally selects an already installed browser.

The extra browser harness is included only with `WORKSPACE_TEST=true`; normal release builds do not include it. `test:workspace` overwrites `dist` with its demo build, so run `npm run build` afterwards to restore a regular build. Browser screenshots go to ignored `output/playwright/`. The validation workflow runs unit tests, emulator/browser tests and a regular build on pull requests and main pushes. Large-data performance suites remain separate from these small deterministic correctness fixtures.

## Remaining implementation work

- Share normalized report snapshots through the cloud in addition to the report connection. The current workspace fetches public eBird report summaries automatically when not cached; manual Refresh loads species details with four concurrent requests, caches a complete snapshot on the device and saves the report connection. Checklist membership is recomputed spatially when a stop moves or changes radius. Missing details are labelled explicitly. Report API availability is still required for an uncached visitor device.
- Add account-cloud persistence and switching for personal life/region lists. Existing owner lists remain on the owner's device; new editors start without those personal flags. This first implementation does not claim cross-device personal-list synchronization.
- Add advisory editor presence, background dataset replacement, reusable dataset ownership and quota accounting.
- Validate the full large-import/mobile-memory budgets and the final cache/download preparation experience. A cached plan does not guarantee downloaded map coverage.
- Define bounded cloud recovery checkpoints and deletion retention beyond persistent device recovery copies and exported backups.

## Verification on 18 October 2026

The earlier backend milestone passed all 24 unit tests, the Firestore/Storage permission suite, the built-PWA offline browser flow, the standard performance suite and a regular production build passed. The release build contains no test harness. The standard fixture stayed within its existing budgets, with 2.1 MB heap growth during repeated navigation; this does not replace the separate large-dataset measurements.

The provided version-1 Oman archive was also imported through the real UI into the local browser, preserving all 63 stops, existing routes and the life-list flags for 385 already-seen species. The original archive file was unchanged and no live cloud migration was performed. In the working workspace, Al Saadah Park retained the reference expected total of 15.0; Booted Eagle showed 36.4% location rate and about 83% cumulative probability. Asia/Muscat was explicitly saved as the trip's time zone and confirmed in Preview. The local working editor is left open for review. The subsequent prototype port adds model/report unit tests and runs the browser suite against the integrated editor, including area edits, undo, bulk shifting and report refresh.

The prototype port was checked on the actual Oman trip against the live public report: 353 checklists were cached, and Al Saadah Park showed 2 report checklists with 27 species, alongside its historical 15.0 expected species. Legacy embedded observer comments are adapted locally; the selected park exposes six comment-bearing checklists with copy/download actions. Prototype replay controls, fictional sharing URLs, simulated save timers and fixture imports are absent from the working workspace. The source archive file and live Firebase project were not modified.

## Workspace performance

Run `npm run perf:workspace` for the actual new interface; the older performance flows still target legacy pages. See `tests/perf/README.md` for scale fixtures, archive mode, budgets, and measurement limits. The new CI check covers the 33,370-location/63-stop case, while the full command also checks 66,740 and 133,480 locations. Local plan application now preserves untouched visit records instead of deleting and rewriting every stop on each keystroke. Spatial membership uses an immutable latitude index, and species clustering runs in a worker so it cannot block typing or selection.

Measured on desktop Chromium on 18 October 2026, with a production build and a local empty basemap to isolate application work:

| Dataset           | Locations | Stops |     Open | Note edit (max of 5) | Select stop | Resize area | JS heap after GC |
| ----------------- | --------: | ----: | -------: | -------------------: | ----------: | ----------: | ---------------: |
| 1x before fixes   |    33,370 |    63 | 3,277 ms |             1,398 ms |    1,137 ms |    1,143 ms |            72 MB |
| 1x after fixes    |    33,370 |    63 | 1,019 ms |                33 ms |       38 ms |       53 ms |            55 MB |
| 2x after fixes    |    66,740 |    63 | 1,428 ms |                42 ms |       48 ms |       49 ms |            77 MB |
| 4x after fixes    |   133,480 |    63 | 2,282 ms |                61 ms |       54 ms |       60 ms |           122 MB |
| Real Oman archive |     5,305 |    63 |   800 ms |                41 ms |       52 ms |       52 ms |           126 MB |

The Oman archive retains older embedded checklist data, so its memory shape differs from the synthetic processed EBD. Its original file remains unchanged. Report data in these repeatable tests is seeded (353 lists); public API download latency is not part of the benchmark. Live Oman UI verification separately retained Al Saadah Park's 41 historical species, 11 checklists, 2 locations, 27 report species, and the 15.0 expected-species total, including Booted Eagle's 36.4% location / 83.2% cumulative probabilities.

Remaining performance work should focus on actual phone/Safari measurements, legacy archive normalization and peak loading memory, raw EBD import, and explicit large-scale clustering throughput. The current desktop benchmark covers editing, radius recomputation, selection, tables and heap; it does not claim those remaining paths are fully optimized.

## C3 visual implementation · 19 October 2026

The working workspace now follows the selected Mineral direction: soft white, muted teal, system sans-serif typography, and Bootstrap Icons throughout. The approved navigation uses one desktop toolbar, with trip selection/settings on the left, Map/Species centrally, and actions on the right. Mobile keeps the view switch visible and places actions in a menu. The existing desktop width separator and mobile itinerary sheet remain available.

The selected stop owns one inline editor. Its icon opens the native type selector, its name is directly editable, and the adjacent refresh icon generates the name from the nearest historical location. Date/time and duration stay visible. One initially collapsed Details section contains shared targets, notes, historical EBD statistics, actual trip-report statistics, observer comments with copy/download, and stop removal. Bulk selection retains the common time-shift editor. Name typing no longer rebuilds the itinerary DOM. The species view keeps the original columns and calculations, with filters and both probability sliders always visible.

`src/components/workspace/c3.css` holds the visual pass after the earlier prototype stylesheet. Mapbox Outdoors retains its cartography, paths and labels, with restrained background/water adjustments and teal route/area overlays; satellite imagery is unchanged. Historical checklist locations keep their two-colour size encoding, species rates their separate scale, and trip-report pins their blue eBird symbols. Account, synchronization, sharing permissions and offline persistence are unchanged by this design pass.

Validation for the C3 pass: 31 unit tests, cloud permission checks, and the built-PWA browser flow passed, covering inline edits, report refresh, worker clustering, offline editing/reload/reconnect, public visitors, editor conflicts, recovery downloads and lost acknowledgements. The 33,370-location/63-stop performance fixture passed: 977 ms open, 48 ms maximum note edit, 38 ms stop selection, 52 ms radius edit and 55 MB heap after GC on this desktop. These measurements exclude internet basemap latency. Real Oman review preserved Al Saadah Park's 41 historical species / 11 checklists / 2 locations, 27 report species / 2 checklists, and 15.0 expected species. Desktop and 390 × 844 layouts were visually reviewed; this is not a physical-phone benchmark.

### Map controls and shared dropdowns · 19 October 2026

Fit trip and Map key now use icon buttons in the Mapbox control stack beneath My location. A 38 px Layers button sits at the bottom right (above the mobile itinerary); the menu groups basemaps and overlays and closes on outside click or Escape. Basemaps are Outdoor Mineral, Satellite, Streets, and Light, using the existing Mapbox account. Switching styles restores app overlays and preserves the camera; initial fitting happens once. Visitor view has the same compact menu with historical overlays initially off.

Shared native selects, Bootstrap menus, searchable selectors, and workspace menus use Mineral typography, colours, focus states, and five-pixel corners. Browsers supporting customizable native selects also receive the styled open picker; other browsers retain their platform picker. This preserves native keyboard interaction and mobile selection without another dropdown dependency.

Validation: 31 unit tests and production build passed. Live browser checks covered all four basemap selections, rebuilt checklist/report overlays, Fit trip, Map key, the stop-type picker, and the layer menu at desktop and 390 px mobile widths. No itinerary data was changed during these checks.

Map menu refinement: historical hotspots and personal locations have independent visibility switches over the same cached EBD source, retaining their existing green/ochre colours and size scale. Each overlay label includes its corresponding rendered symbol; subtitles and the redundant legend footer are removed. The basemap chooser is now just Map / Satellite with lazy-loaded Mapbox static image previews (fixed example location, no trip coordinates). Streets and Light are removed from this menu. Layer and geolocation icons use the same centred control styling. Additional national basemap providers remain future scope.

## Central settings and display preferences

Trip settings now opens a modal from the header gear. It groups trip metadata, backup download, the existing import/library entry point, eBird report connection/refresh, personal list uploads, map style and stop display. Imports still use the existing Trips page and its collision handling; they have not been rewritten. Sharing stays accessible from the toolbar. Undo is directly accessible, disabled with no history; redo appears only when available. The existing 50-step history and keyboard shortcuts remain.

Stop display preferences place each optional editor field in Default (visible in the selected stop editor), Details (inside its collapsed section), or Hidden. Date/time, duration, targets, notes, historical summaries, report results and observer comments are configurable. The type/name identity remains available. Preferences move the existing DOM controls, retaining input handlers and underlying values. They persist in localStorage on this browser/device, separately from the shared plan. Visitor report summaries remain visible regardless of hidden editor fields. Reset restores the compact layout. Map/Satellite remains a two-tile switch; settings chooses Outdoor, Streets or Light for the Map tile. These are Mapbox styles, not newly integrated national providers.

## Proposed next migrations (not implemented)

An undated itinerary needs a shared-plan format that explicitly stores sequence independently of optional date/time. Today `buildWorkspacePlan` sorts visits by date/time; the controller also sorts edits/additions by date, groups by calendar day, compares dates for past/future symbols and chooses route predecessors from this order. Hiding dates alone would not create a reliable sequence editor. Migrate existing stops in their current order; keep dates when changing display/planning mode, and never synthesize dates for undated stops. Define how mixed scheduled/unscheduled stops appear, how date edits affect sequence and how to resolve an order/date conflict before enabling the switch. Undated stops need neutral temporal symbols and no inferred before/live/after state. Route invalidation, bulk shifts, expected-species ordering, backup round trips, cloud validation and offline recovery must all use the same semantics. Report membership should remain spatial and independent of planned date, as it is now.

The root URL already redirects to `/workspace`; this path is a route name, not a second application. Removing old screens is distinct from replacing persistence. Recommended order:

1. Bring trip library, creation, EBD/comment import and backup import (including name collisions, progress/errors, cloud library, deletion and quota handling) into new-interface dialogs/views. Reuse the existing processing functions and keep imported records intact.
2. Audit workspace parity against old BuildTrip/SpeciesMap/SpeciesList, especially filters, exports and map computation; port any required remaining behavior. Update performance tests that currently navigate legacy pages.
3. Redirect old URLs to the new Map/Species/library destination while preserving cloud/edit queries. Remove old navigation and page bundles once new workflows pass desktop/mobile, offline, migration/import/export and emulator sharing/recovery checks. The user-facing landing route can become `/` while old workspace/shared URLs remain aliases.
4. Separately simplify compatibility adapters and legacy-only fields after backup migration tests pass. Keep IndexedDB, spatial computation, workers, report loading and sync that are still needed; deleting old page components does not require rebuilding them. Do not combine a storage rewrite with the visual cutover.

The screen cutover is a bounded migration over several changes; replacing the underlying storage and archive formats is a larger task. Undated planning should follow the screen cutover so its schema migration can be tested against one active editor.

## Trip library and retirement of old screens

`/` now opens `/trips` (My trips). A root shared link with `cloud` still opens the trip directly. `/workspace` is the sole editor/visitor interface. `/create` redirects to My trips, `/buildTrip` and `/speciesMap` to the map workspace, and `/speciesList` to its Species view; query parameters are retained. The old CreateTrip, BuildTrip, SpeciesMap, SpeciesList and CloudTrips components and old navigation were removed, rather than maintained in parallel. Their page-specific performance scripts were retired; active editor performance and raw EBD import benchmarks remain.

The supported library features are a combined device/cloud list, search, empty-trip creation, creation from historical EBD with the existing streaming/filtering processor, compressed/JSON backup import as a separate trip, backup download, account sign-in/out and capacity requests. Settings/report connection, personal bird lists, sharing and planning stay in the trip. The editor has a My trips link. New signed-in trips enable cloud autosave by default; signed-out/offline trips stay on the device, with an explicit enable action later. A failed cloud setup keeps the newly created local trip available. The old manual archive-saving interface is gone. `tripCloudSetup.js` is the one setup path for library creation and existing-trip migration; subsequent edits still use revision-checked plan sync and offline recovery.

Existing IndexedDB records are retained, including itinerary, source data, notes, personal flags, routes, report IDs and cached report snapshots. The library never loads full EBD datasets just to list trips; it reads trip metadata, indexed stop counts and sync state. Older cloud archives download as separate local copies and can be migrated by their owner through Enable cloud autosave. Opening an older archive does not overwrite its cloud file. Source uploads still require the deployed workspace rules and existing storage allowance; this UI transition does not deploy rules or migrate live Firebase records automatically.

Backup export includes a cached workspace report when available, and imports restore that snapshot alongside the existing v1–v3 archive fields. Cloud-only backups join the current shared plan to the sanitized dataset archive so the itinerary is not omitted. Report IDs and shared stop targets remain part of the backup. Device removal first downloads a backup; recovery copies must be reviewed before removal. Cloud deletion is a separate explicit confirmation and retains device copies. No real user trips were deleted during development/testing.

The browser suite now exercises the new landing/library, empty creation and first stop, real raw EBD processing with comments, compressed backup download/import without replacing the original, older JSON stops/notes/targets/report IDs, redirects, and mobile layout, followed by the existing cloud/offline/sharing suite. No new archive format or destructive database migration was introduced. Undated planning remains separate future work.

The library transition also fills missing creation/update timestamps from early archives so those records remain visible in the indexed trip list. The emulator browser suite checks both opening an old cloud archive without changing its revision and explicitly upgrading it without losing its note/report connection. Signed-in new-trip creation is checked with automatic cloud setup; a cloud-only export is checked for its current itinerary.

## Maintenance baseline

ESLint with the Vue essential preset checks executable application, worker, scripts and test code. Prettier handles consistent JS/Vue/CSS formatting and preserves Markdown paragraphs. Knip checks unused code and dependencies, including explicit worker and harness entry points. The old unused LifeList component, bundle loader, EBD update signal, map style control, conflict helper and their unused exports were removed, along with `vue-select` and `@vueform/slider`. IndexedDB tables and stored trip records were not removed. Error translations retain the original `cause` for debugging. No additional detailed test framework was introduced; validation continues to prioritize major workflows and dataset-scale performance.
